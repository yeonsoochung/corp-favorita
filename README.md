## Analysis of on-promo sales at a large Ecuadorian grocery chain.

Corporación Favorita provided sales data ranging from 2013 to 2017. The data includes information on stores, items, number of units sold, number of items sold on promo, number of transactions at specifc store/date combos (but no transaction data at the itemized level), and oil prices, which have a significant impact on Ecuador's economy. The "On Promotion" data is given as True/False, and I filtered out its null values, which truncated the data set's date range to Apr. 2014 - Aug. 2017.

In this project, I analyzed the data pertaining to items sold on promo. I developed a Power BI dashboard that enables the user to view units sold over time and % of units sold on-promo over time. The dashboard's interactive features allow the user to analyze these trends based on item category, location, different time granularities, and comparing with oil prices.
